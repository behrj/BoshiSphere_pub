Welcome to **BoshiSphere**, the perfect little tool for your boshi-style hat-making projects!

## What is BoshiSphere?

**BoshiSphere** is a smart calculator that helps you create perfectly shaped spheres and round crochet projects—without any math or guesswork.

Simply enter:

- **The width of one stitch**
- **The height of one stitch**
- **The target circumference** of the sphere or circular project you want to make

BoshiSphere will automatically calculate **how many stitches you need on each row** as your project increases and decreases in size.
For a nice hat, just add a couple of rows with the maximum count and a round of crab stitches at the end, if you like it. 

Whether you're making amigurumi heads, decorative balls, or custom-fit hats, BoshiSphere gives you a clear, accurate pattern every time.
